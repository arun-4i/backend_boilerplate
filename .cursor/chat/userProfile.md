1) Profile Fields: What specific fields should the UserProfile model have? I'm thinking:
avatar (string - URL/path)
bio (text)
phone (string)
dateOfBirth (date)
address (text)
preferences (JSON)
socialLinks (JSON)
isPublic (boolean)
#This table structure is ok go ahead.
2) Association: Should this be a one-to-one relationship where each user can have exactly one profile, or one-to-many where users can have multiple profiles?
#Make sure users have multiple profiles.
3) Encryption: Should profile data be encrypted like other sensitive data in your system?
#No need to encrypt data before storing. 
4) Validation: Any specific validation rules for profile fields (phone format, date ranges, etc.)?
#Follow all industry standard validations and make sure to validate all fields.
5) Audit Logging: Should profile changes be audited separately from user changes?
#No log it all in same place for now.
