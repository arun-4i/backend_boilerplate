# Logging Technologies, Practices, and Retention Policies for Node.js + TypeScript Backend

---

## 1. Open-Source Logging Tech Stack

### Log Aggregation & Search Tools

| Tool          | Description                                                                                   | Use Case                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Elastic Stack (ELK)** | Elasticsearch (store/index), Logstash/Beats (collect/ship), Kibana (UI for visualization) | Powerful, flexible, industry-standard log management |
| **Loki + Grafana**       | Loki for log aggregation, Grafana for dashboards and alerting                        | Lightweight, scalable, integrates well with metrics   |
| **Graylog**              | Centralized logging with alerting and search; simpler setup than ELK                  | Easy to use with good UI, supports multiple inputs    |

### Winston Transports (Integration Helpers)

| Transport             | Purpose                                  | Compatible Tools        |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `winston-elasticsearch` | Send logs directly to Elasticsearch     | Elastic Stack           |
| `winston-loki`          | Send logs directly to Loki               | Loki + Grafana          |
| `winston-mongodb`       | Store logs in MongoDB                    | MongoDB (if used)       |
| `winston-logstash`      | Ship logs to Logstash                    | Elastic Stack           |

### Log Visualization & Monitoring UIs

- **Kibana:** ELK stack UI for search and dashboards
- **Grafana:** UI for Loki and metrics visualization
- **Graylog UI:** Centralized log management dashboard

## 2. Logging Best Practices

### What to Log

- **Errors & Exceptions:** Full stack trace, error codes
- **Warnings:** Recoverable issues
- **Business Events:** User logins, transactions, data changes
- **System Events:** Service lifecycle, config changes
- **Security Events:** Auth attempts, permission changes
- **Request Metadata:** Timestamp, user ID, endpoint, response status
- **Performance Metrics:** Slow queries, response time

### What NOT to Log

- Passwords, API keys, tokens, credit card data
- Sensitive PII unless regulated and compliant
- Excessive debug logs in production
- Redundant or noisy logs

### Audit Logging

- Logs who did what, when, and where
- Includes user ID, action, timestamp, target resource, outcome
- Supports compliance, security audits, and accountability

### Additional Practices

- Use **correlation IDs** for request tracing
- Use **structured JSON logs** for machine readability
- Centralize logs for easy search and analysis
- Implement **log rotation** and **retention policies**
- Use **asynchronous logging** to prevent blocking
- Set up **alerts** for critical events

## 3. Retention Policies & Storage Guidelines

| Log Type          | Storage Location        | Retention Period       | Reason                              |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Audit Logs        | Database               | 1-7 years             | Compliance and long-term traceability |
| Security Events   | Database or SIEM       | â‰¥ 1 year              | For investigations and threat detection |
| Application Logs  | Files or Centralized Logging System (ELK, Loki, Graylog) | 30-90 days            | Operational troubleshooting       |
| Performance Logs  | Files or Monitoring DB | 30-90 days            | Trend analysis and optimization   |

### Storage Guidelines

- **Databases** for structured, queryable, and compliance-critical logs (audit, security)
- **Log files / centralized systems** for high-volume, operational logs (app logs, performance)
- Enable **log rotation** and **archiving** to manage disk space
- Secure logs with **access control** and **encryption** where necessary

## 4. Summary Recommendations

- For full-featured enterprise logging: use **Elastic Stack (ELK)**
- For lightweight, cost-effective logging + metrics: use **Loki + Grafana**
- For easier setup and centralized logging: use **Graylog**
- Integrate Winston with appropriate transports for seamless log shipping
